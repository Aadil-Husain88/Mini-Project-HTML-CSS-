                <h3>The Taj Mahal</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses 
                    nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 
                    in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, 
                    the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. </p>

                <h3>The Colosseum</h3>
                <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient 
                    amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under 
                    the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir,Titus (r. 79–81).
                    The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. 
                    It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,having an average audience of some 65,000.</p>

                <h3>The Chichen Itza</h3>
                <p>Chichen Itza[nb 1] was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. 
                    The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands 
                    from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200).
                    The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.
                    The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, 
                    but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.Chichen Itza is one of 
                    the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.</p>

                <h3>The Machu Picchu</h3>
                <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. 
                    It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. 
                    The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. Most recent archaeologists 
                    believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472).Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, 
                    with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.</p>

                <p>Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and 
                    built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. 
                    Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, 
                    excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.

                <h3>The Petra</h3>
                <p>Petra is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, 
                    in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
                    The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become 
                    the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean 
                    presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, 
                    when its famous Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, 
                    and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.</p>

                <h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>
                <p>The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient 
                    Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. 
                    Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined 
                    together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.
                    The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).Apart from defense, other purposes of 
                    the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road</p>
